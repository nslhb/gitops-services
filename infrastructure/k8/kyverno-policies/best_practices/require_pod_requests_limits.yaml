    policies.kyverno.io/description: As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important 
      to limit resources requested and consumed by each pod. It is recommended to require 
      'resources.requests' and 'resources.limits' per pod. If a namespace level request or limit is 
      specified, defaults will automatically be applied to each pod based on the 'LimitRange' configuration.
